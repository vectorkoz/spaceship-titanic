# spaceship-titanic
This repo contains my submissions to the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic) competition on Kaggle.

## ibm-deep-learning-final-project
This project employs different types of Artificial Neural Networks to achieve a decent result in the competition. It uses Python, Jupyter Notebook, keras, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. This project contains:
 - initial data processing.
 - constructing 4 types of neural networks using different depths, Dropout and Batch Normalization.
 - hyperparameter search for the neural networks with K-fold cross validation.
 - predicting using standalone models and ensembles.

The best results were achieved using ensembles of neural networks with Batch Normalization (see below).
